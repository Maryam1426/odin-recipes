        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My variation of an old Southern Living recipe - a double recipe will fill a Dutch oven and make plenty for an extended family dinner.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>7 ounces whole wheat spaghetti</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.</li>
